# Contributing to Python-valve #####

Thank you for wanting to contribute to Python-valve. Whether you're
reporting an issue, submitting a pull request or anything else, please
be aware of this project's [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
To summarise: *be polite, be respectful, be empathetic*.

Additionally, it is expected that English is used in all issues, pull
requests, code, commit messages, etc.. If English is not your first
language, your best effort attempt will be appreciated and treated with
the necessary patience.

Finally, whether it's a bug report, pull request or a feature requests.
Please check to make sure that it is not a duplicate of an existing
discussion. If it is a duplicate, add to the existing discussion instead.


## Bug Reports ####

When reporting issues with Python-valve, please follow the template that
is provided to the best of your ability. Sometimes the scope of the issue
means that the template isn't entirely relevant. In these cases it's cool
to ignore the irrelevant parts. :+1:


## Pull Requests ####

Always feel free to submit pull requests. When doing so, please include,
at minimum, a short description of what the pull request is for. If the
pull request addresses a specific issue, please refer back to that issue.
However, entirely speculative pull requests are also appreciated.

For more complex pull requests, please be more elaborate in your
description.

A few criteria must be met before a pull request will be accepted:

- When adding **new code**, it *must* have **accompanying tests**. It
  *must* also **pass all linting checks**.
- Ideally **all tests must pass**, on all platforms. It's okay to modify
  tests. It *might* be okay to skip tests or mark them as failing. If in
  doubt, mention it in the pull request description or comments.
- If intentionally making non-backwards compatible, **breaking changes**,
  you **must include a justification**. Ideally, please also demonstrate
  that you've thought through the implications.
- If modifying or adding to the public API, the corresponding
  **documentation must be updated**.

Everyone deserves credit for their work. Therefore, in addition
to the above requirements, you may wish to add yourself to the formal
[list of contributors](../CONTRIBUTORS.md), with a very brief description
of your contribution(s). This is entirely optional though.


## Ideas and Feature Requests ####

It's completely fine to open an issue for ideas and feature requests.
When creating such issues, please be as descriptive as possible and
include a concrete use case.


## If in doubt ... ####
